# NordUser RefCard
This Python script creates a program list reference card for Nord keyboards by transforming the HTML output from the Nord Sound Manager program.
The reference card is a grid based on page and program. 
For keyboards with more than one bank of sounds, a separate grid is produced for each bank. 

It works for the Electro 4 and Stage 2 keyboards.

This has been tested with the output of Nord Sound Manager 6.86 build 734_12 [OSX Intel].
