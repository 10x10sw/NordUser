# NordUser DumpNE4P

## What This Script Does
This Python script attempts to print the program parameters for
Nord Electro 4 NE4P Program files saved by the Nord Sound Manager program.
This has been tested with the output of Nord Sound Manager 6.86 build 734_12 [OSX Intel].

## Why This Script
Nord does not provide a way to see the parameters that have been applied to programs
using their software. You must tweak parameters by hand and listen to understand their values.
This script allows a Nord Electro user to see the program values both for understanding and sharing.

## What You Need

This script requires an NE4P file generated by Nord Sound Manager. 
This is a binary file containing a single Nord Electro 4 Program.
You must hook up your Nord keyboard to Nord Sound Manager version 6.86 or newer,
select one or more Programs, and choose "Sound Uploadâ€¦" from the "File" menu.
The Nord software will create one or more files. This script uses the "Program" file
(for example: "Nord Electro 4 Program 2016-11-02.html"). 

## Help
Here is the output of `python dump_ne4p.py -h` :
```
usage: dump_ne4p.py [-h] inputFile

positional arguments:
